Scripts used to compare protein properties  of psychrophilic and mesophilic bacteria to examine molecular traits of cold adaptation. 

Non-hypothetical protein and mesophilic matches (full proteins) are assessed for cold adaptation at the amino acid level for the following indices: arginine to lysine ratio; frequency of acidic residues; proline residues; aromaticity; aliphacity; and grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY).
